<p>You have accomplished a lot.  Across the time continuum of this whole experience, you have captured the essence of what it means to be an Early Talent at SAP - in your time, in my time, in our time.</p>

<p>But, while you have influenced the SAP of 2045 with your efforts, there is still much to do.  The future is only assured by the present.  Your 'NOW',</p>

<p><b>This is your time.</b></p> 

<p>Take your knowledge of SAP, our customers, our partners, our sectors, our products, our processes and most importantly, our people and continue to apply that knowledge to the challenges you face today and the opportunities you may face tomorrow.</p>
<p>We have one final mission for you. Keep this game going by adding your own missions and challenges for your colleagues to complete. Challenge one another into shaping the future of SAP and the world. Come back often to see your colleagueâ€™s submissions and to provide feedback to those who are completing the missions you post.</p>
