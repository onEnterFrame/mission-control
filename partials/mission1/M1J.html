<p>Ok. Now that you've looked at the Early Talent Jam Group, we would really appreciate learning more about you.</p>


<p>One of the biggest challenges that we face in the future is that while we can look up different things you've 'done' in your time at SAP historically, we don't really know the people. We want to know who you are.</p>


<p>Go to the Early Talent Jam Group and introduce yourself.</p>



<p>Look for the discussion called 'Introduce Yourself' and share (at least) the following:</p>


<ul>

<li>Where you are from</li>

<li>Where you work</li>

<li>Your school/work background</li>

<li>Why you chose SAP</li>

</ul>


<p>As a personal favor, we would also love it if you shared something of your home and culture. How about a favorite culinary dish that represents where you are from? Maybe hearing about some of the different types of items available in your time will inspire us to try some new things in ours!</p>
